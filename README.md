 Andrew Meier's scripts for artifact masking and processing raw fieldtrip data into freq bands of interest

Contains common code for projects including DBS-Triplet, DBS-SEQ

Major areas of functionality:
-preprocessing (with respect to particular freq bands, esp. high gamma and beta): artifact demarcation, referencing, extracting timecourses at freq band of interest
-plotting: plotting average timecourses of individual electrodes; plotting electrodes on brain surface plots
