Scripts for artifact masking and processing raw fieldtrip data into freq bands of interest

-scripts by Andrew Meier and Anita Kelcher

Contains common code for projects including DBS-Triplet, DBS-SEQ


Major areas of functionality:

-preprocessing (with respect to particular freq bands, esp. high gamma and beta): artifact demarcation, referencing, extracting timecourses at freq band of interest

-plotting: plotting average timecourses of individual electrodes; plotting electrodes on brain surface plots
